Tornado User Interface
===========================
This work attempts to organize the work on M55 alternative interface and unify 
the look and feel of the created applications. 

It also provides better memory management of the screen objects 
(important if you want to keep your apps running longer).

The code base is now considered stable and most dependencies have been
stripped to allow branding and customization for deployment
