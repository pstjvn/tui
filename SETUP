This document describes how to setup the development environment for the TUI SDK
For instructions on how to deploy it in your production environment please read the DEPLOY document

Prerequisites:
==============
Web server with proxy support (apache, lighttpd, etc)
Tornado M55 device (with enabled developer mode, contact Sysmaster if you do not have one)
Tornado M55 firmware version >= 109
Web browser with WebSocket support (for in browser development)

Configuration:
==============
+ Download the source and put it in a path that can be served by your http server
+ Configure the proxy mode of your server (The following step is only required 
if you want to use server (streamer/contentMGT) settings options,	
it makes those available as global option object, it can be skipped )), following 
example is for lighttpd, other http server might require different options):
	proxy.server = ( "/cgi-bin/" => ( "m55" => ( "host" => "192.168.2.64" ))) 
where the host should be the hostname or IP of your m55 device.
+ The Tornado m55 device should be correctly configured itself (i.e. 
streaming server and PIN number as a minimum)
+ Set the debug device option in your copy of the SDK: add the file config.js
in app/appdebug with the followinf content:
    define({
        socket: 'ws://192.168.2.64:7681'
    });
Substitute the IP with the one configured on your development Tornado device


At this point your development environment should be ready, start your Tornado 
device, using the URL of your http server that hosts the SDK as startURL option
and then open your browser with the same URL. Open your web console to see any 
errors and  warnings. Note that only webkit based browsers and firefox are
supported but webkit based ones are recomended as those match closest the 
browser utilized in the tornado devices. 

The static files will be server from yout http server (including the controlling 
JS locig) while the user data and application data will be loaded from your
Tornado device.
